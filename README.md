# rtcnet

This is my attempt at building and easy to use, client-server webrtc-based net.Conn implementation. Feel free to use it and file bug reports. I am by no means a webrtc expert, so if you see any problems with my implementation, then feel free to open an issue! Happy to answer any questions as needed!
